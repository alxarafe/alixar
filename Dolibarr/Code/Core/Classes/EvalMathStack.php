 *
 * ================================================================================
 *
 * NAME
 * EvalMath - safely evaluate math expressions
 *
 * SYNOPSIS
 * include('evalmath.class.php');
 * $m = new EvalMath;
 * // basic evaluation:
 * $result = $m->evaluate('2+2');
 * // supports: order of operation; parentheses; negation; built-in functions
 * $result = $m->evaluate('-8(5/2)^2*(1-sqrt(4))-8');
 * // create your own variables
 * $m->evaluate('a = e^(ln(pi))');
 * // or functions
 * $m->evaluate('f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2 - 2x*y + 1');
 * // and then use them
 * $result = $m->evaluate('3*f(42,a)');
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * Use the EvalMath class when you want to evaluate mathematical expressions
 * from untrusted sources. You can define your own variables and functions,
 * which are stored in the object. Try it, it's fun!
 *
 * METHODS
 * $m->evaluate($expr)
 * Evaluates the expression and returns the result. If an error occurs,
 * prints a warning and returns false. If $expr is a function assignment,
 * returns true on success.
 *
 * $m->e($expr)
 * A synonym for $m->evaluate().
 *
 * $m->vars()
 * Returns an associative array of all user-defined variables and values.
 *
 * $m->funcs()
 * Returns an array of all user-defined functions.
 *
 * PARAMETERS
 * $m->suppress_errors
 * Set to true to turn off warnings when evaluating expressions
 *
 * $m->last_error
 * If the last evaluation failed, contains a string describing the error.
 * (Useful when suppress_errors is on).
 *
 * $m->last_error_code
 * If the last evaluation failed, 2 element array with numeric code and extra info
