/**
 * Example controller for a module. Examples of calls:
 *
 *  - index.php?module=Test&controller=Test
 *  - index.php?module=Test&controller=Test&action=testing
 *
 * Explanation of GET variables:
 *
 *  - The module name is assigned in the GET variable 'module'
 *  - The controller name is assigned to the GET variable 'controller'.
 *    The file will have the assigned name followed by 'Controller'.
 *    For example, for controller=Test, the file TestController.php will
 *    be searched in the Test/Controller (module=Test) folder.
 *  - The GET variable 'action' allows to specify the name of an action
 *    to be executed. In that case, the do<ActionName>() method will be
 *    executed.
